# node-shm
==========

Native Node.js module for reading/writing to shared memory compatible with PHP shmop

Description
-----------

This project was created because existing modules did not work as expected or were severely outdated.
We use this to write JSON to the shared memory so that PHP processes can access it with low latency.
